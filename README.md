# ðŸ¥— Bestaurants


## Description
A SPA to help you find the Top 10 Restaurants (The Bestaurants) of any kind in your city. This was my final project at Spiced Academy and a tool I personally wanted to use. 
It uses maps and scraped information from Google Maps and Places API to analyze and sort all available Restaurants in a big city. 
There is also automatic loaction finding and distance validation for the search results.

## Features
- SPA created with React.js
- Mobile first philosophy, created to look like a phone App
- uses proprietary scraping logic (self-written) to request, collect, filter and sort data from Google Places API (please don't tell Google though)
- Guides users through available options and displays results dynamically according to the chosen variables
- Gives results in the form of restaurant lists and dynamically generated maps
- Uses React Redux store to calculate and keep variables, while switching through different views
- Uses location finder API to find the place name of the user's location
- Node.js & Express backend serves JSON with the available restaurant data 
- also calculates nearest matching city, if location doesn't match
